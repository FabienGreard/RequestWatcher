# RequestWatcher

This product was build during the Zeit Hackathon 2019.
Hope you'll enjoy!

## Main Idea

Each call on serverless use some processing time and memory. Zeit does not provide yet a way to visualize those data conveniently. We wanted to change that

## How we tackled it

Processing zeit logs to extract and display conveniently numeric data

## How to use it

### Home Page

Find easily the deployment you want to obverve and click on `overview` to navigate to the watcher

### Watcher Page

On this page you'll find 2 charts with on the side a simple configuration for customization =
 - The first chart can display all the time processing data concerning you deployment (for instance you could visualize the difference between the time required to process your calls and the one you were billed)
 - The second on displays all the memory data
